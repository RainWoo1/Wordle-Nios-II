# Wordle Game

A Wordle Game is a Wordle-inspired game using C and Nios II Assembly on FPGA board, challenging players to guess a five-letter word.
We delivered a highly responsive user experience by optimizing PS2 keyboard input with interrupts and rendering output on a VGA display for smooth gameplay.
